## Keep Secret

#### Obligation of confidentiality

- The _recipient party_ agrees to use the _confidentiality subject_ solely for the _confidentiality purpose_.
- The _recipient party_ agrees to keep the _confidentiality subject_ strictly confidential for the _confidentiality period_.

#### Standard of confidentiality

The _recipient party_ agrees to:

- use industry standard security techniques to prevent;
- immediately notify _disclosing party_ of;
- comply with _disclosing party_'s reasonable instructions regarding; and
- use its best endeavours to mitigate the effects of,

any unauthorised access to or use of the _confidentiality subject_ for which the _recipient party_ is responsible in whole or in part.

#### Disclosures to certain entities

The _recipient party_ may disclose the _confidentiality subject_ to:

- professional advisors like lawyers or accountants; and
- subsidiaries or parent entities,

but only to the extent necessary to effect for the _confidentiality purpose_.

#### Disclosures for legal reasons

- The _recipient party_ may disclose the _confidentiality subject_ if it is, or subsequently comes to be, publicly known through no fault, act, or omission on the part of the _recipient party_.
- The _recipient party_ is also permitted to disclose the _confidentiality subject_ if:
  - the disclosure is necessary in order to enforce the Agreement; or
  - the disclosure is required by law or a binding order of a government agency or court, but (to the extent permitted by law) the _recipient party_ must not make such a disclosure without first notifying _disclosing party_ and giving _disclosing party_ a reasonable opportunity to object to the disclosure.
- The _recipient party_ must comply with _disclosing party_'s reasonable requests with regard to any permitted disclosure.
- The _recipient party_ must use reasonable endeavours to ensure any person receiving the _confidentiality subject_ through a permitted disclosure will treat it confidentially, and under substantially the same obligations as these confidentiality obligations.

#### Damages not an adequate remedy

- The parties agree that:
  - the value of keeping the _confidentiality subject_ confidential is difficult to assess; and
  - damages would not be an adequate remedy for the irreparable harm that would be caused by the the _recipient party_'s breach of these confidentiality obligations.
- If the _recipient party_ actually breaches or threatens to breach these confidentiality obligations, _disclosing party_ will be entitled to enforce the _recipient party_'s confidentiality obligations by injunctive relief or specific performance, in addition to any other available remedy. The _disclosing party_ will not be required to prove actual or special damage in order to do so.

#### Effects of Disclosure

The disclosure of the _confidentiality subject_ from a _disclosing party_ to a _recipient party_ under the Agreement will not:

- have the effect of granting any rights over Intellectual Property Rights in the _confidentiality subject_;
- establish any relationship between the parties other than that created explicitly by the Agreement; or
- impose any obligation on a _disclosing party_ to disclose accurate or current information in the _confidentiality subject_.

#### Mutual obligations

Each party to the Agreement may simultaneously be a _disclosing party_ and a _recipient party_ with respect to the obligations above.
