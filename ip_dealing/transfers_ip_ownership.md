## Transfers Intellectual Property Ownership

- The _assignor_ assigns all current and future Intellectual Property Rights in the _transfer subject_ to _assignee_.
- The assignment is global unless the clause specifies a particular territory for the assignment, in which case the Intellectual Property Rights are assigned in that territory only.
- The _assignor_ warrants and represents to _assignee_ that it has the right to transfer the Intellectual Property Rights under this clause and that the _assignee_'s legitimate exercise of the assigned Intellectual Property Rights will not infringe the rights of any third party.
- The _assignor_ agrees to do all things necessary to give effect to the foregoing assignment of Intellectual Property Rights.
- The _assignor_ gives (and where it does not hold the relevant moral rights warrants that it will obtain) any moral rights waivers and consents necessary to ensure the _assignee_ can deal in the Intellectual Property Rights in the _transfer subject_ in accordance with this clause without infringing moral rights.
