# Law Functions

Law functions is a [Query Law](https://querylaw.com/au) project to make contracts shorter and faster to draft.

At the moment we have law functions for:

- [confidentiality](https://github.com/querylaw/lawfunctions/tree/master/confidentiality);
- [dispute resolution process](https://github.com/querylaw/lawfunctions/tree/master/dispute_resolution);
- [limitation of liability](https://github.com/querylaw/lawfunctions/tree/master/liability_limitation);
- [end agreement boilerplate](https://github.com/querylaw/lawfunctions/tree/master/end_contract); and
- [restraint](https://github.com/querylaw/lawfunctions/tree/master/restraint).

We use law functions with a snippet of interpretation language that describes how it works.

> - Parameters in definitions are indicated with italic text.
> - Defined terms are capitalised and not legally effective except as described below.
> - Provisions using definitions with parameters (**Parameter Provisions**) are not legally effective except as described below.
> - Parameter Provisions will be read as replaced with the rights and obligations in the definition, and parameters will be substituted with the equivalent concepts in the Parameter Provision on a plain reading of it.
> - The Parameter Provision may stipulate exceptions, which will be read as an exception to the rights and obligations in the definition.
> - Where a definition refers to rights and obligations as "these" or "this" it refers to those created by the replacement of the Parameter Provision with the definition.
