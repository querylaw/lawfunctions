To the fullest extent permitted by law, _limiting party_ excludes all liability (including consequential loss) to _limited party_ for any liabilities connected directly or indirectly with the _limited party_ and _limiting party_ dealings in relation to the _limitation subject_, including liabilities based on:

- contract law;
- tort law; or
- legislation,

and including liabilities caused by any _limitation risks_.

#### Indemnities not limited

The foregoing limitation of liability will not apply to indemnities given by _limiting party_ to _limited party_ under the Agreement.

#### Implied Conditions

To the fullest extent permitted by the law, all terms and conditions implied by any other source of law in relation to dealings between the _limiting party_ and the _limited party_ in respect of the _limitation subject_ are excluded from the Agreement.

#### Compulsory Conditions

To the fullest extent permitted by the law, _limiting party_'s liability to the _limited party_ for breaching a Compulsory Condition in relation to the _limitation subject_ is limited to:

- in a case where a breach is deemed to be a breach in respect of goods:
  - the replacement of the relevant goods or the supply of equivalent goods;
  - the repair of the relevant goods;
  - the payment of the cost of replacing the relevant goods or of acquiring equivalent goods; or
  - the payment of the cost of having the relevant goods repaired; and

- in a case where a breach is deemed to be a breach in respect of services:
  - the resupply of the relevant services; or
  - payment of a sum equal to the cost of resupplying the relevant services.

The _limiting party_ will choose which of these options will apply.
